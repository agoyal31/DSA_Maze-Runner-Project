# Part D: Reflections


## Reflection for Name_Of_Student_1

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
  - In this assignent there were mainly 3 module to work with. I worked on half of part a of a3 and I did full part b myself. To be specific, the a part was actually to implement minheap. I have implemented MinHeap constructor which is initialising an array or list of heap. Inside this function, it is calling the min heapify function starting from the first non leaf node and going back till root. This way we ensure that the min heap property is maintined. Moving on, the insert function was made to append or insert a new element in the heap. After it was inserted, min heap is maintained by moving the elements up the parent (if needed). There are 2 other function, get_min and extract_min which are responsible for getting the minimum value from the heap and removing it from the heap(by swapping with the last one) respectively.
    Moving further, I also did the a3 part b which was responsible for making the minimum spanning tree function. I was the kruskal's algoithm which requires the use od disjoint sets to find the minimum spanning tree. There was also an option of doing it with prim's algorithm which required use of min heap but we did not went down that path. So, there were some basic steps taken to solve it. First was an array of triplet was made containing weight, from and to index. Them it was sorted acc to weights. This will ensure that min weight are at top. Then usign the make_set function, all the vertex were made in their own set. Then find_set was used to check what is the setList.front.data is. Or where the setlist is pointing to. If the setlists for to and from are different, they are unioned. Union was responsible for making the setlist of the two vertex the same. This way next time if any one vertex is pointing to the same data, it will not be unioned. After that, once unioned, we add the from and to index in the MST list. And finally the list is returned. The reason it si always shortest because, it is arranged assending order. Whenever we are making union of the two vertexes, due to array being sorted the smaller data or weights will be the first one unionised and other will then be somehow already included. Thus, we will get a minimum spanning tree.
    
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

- I learned alot in this assignment. Firstly, it helped me to understand exactly how the min heap works. I never knew that we have to call the minheap from the leaf node back to the root. Also, the minheapify function itself is a recursive function because it ensures that once it changed somehing, it will check its childern and make sure that min heap property is maintained. Moving further, I never knew how the disjoint sets were implemented and how the kruskal algorithm was so effective in finding the MST. It is doing so because of the sorted order of weights that we used. Various other functions are helping as explained above. So, those are things that I learned because I knew the theoury earlier but now I am aware of the implementation.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
- Most challanging aspect in this was to implement the MST using kruskal's algorithm. I totally forgot how the disjoint sets were woking, and how the setlists were pointing. It got really tricky and confusing. So, after spending 2 days on it, I have to make it with pen and paper and have ot do all manually. After that the things became clear that how the disjoint set was made and how all the vertexes were made as a set and based on if they are pointed by same setlist or differnet, they are made union. This way we will not duplicate the sets and one we union two vertices, they are taken as tuple and appeneded in an array. This is allworking due to sorting being done on the weights.  I was also sorting it incorrectly, then after researching, I made it sorted by weights. So, this was the most chalanging aspect as this whole research took quiet some time.
